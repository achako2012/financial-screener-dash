    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For the ICA part 2, I decided to make application for screening and analyze financial data of currency exchange market. For my prospective one of the most demanded area of data science is Financial. The finance industry generates lots of data. Big data in finance refers to the petabytes of structured and unstructured data that can be used for creation strategies for business institutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these parts I want to describe designe, cleaning data approach, and implement applicaion steps of screen market prices application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here some examples of the real screning services:\n",
    " - [finviz](https://finviz.com/)\n",
    " - [finance.yahoo](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC?p=%5EGSPC)\n",
    " - [investing](https://www.investing.com/equities/apple-computer-inc)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, in this project, I'll use some principles of technical analysis of the price charts and some special terminology. Anyway, I'll try to describe everything in simple language for a non-technical person. But, if you don't have any understanding of what price charts in the market are, you would find all the basic information in this article: [Understanding Basic Candlestick Charts](https://www.investopedia.com/trading/candlestick-charting-what-is-it/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since it's only a demo project, we will create something not complicated but with all main features that needed for real price screening application:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Charts with different display options\n",
    "2. Slider with ability to change date range\n",
    "3. Indicator - another chart with some displayed price analyse\n",
    "4. Data frames with different currency pairs\n",
    "5. Data frames with different timeframes\n",
    "6. Possobility to retrieve data by year from data frame\n",
    "7. \\[Optional\\] Dark and light theme for the chart.\n",

    "The most important thing to find a proper data. I desided to take a real financial data from [BITSTAMP EXCHANGE DATA](https://www.cryptodatadownload.com/data/bitstamp). For demo prospects I took only few currency pairs: <span style=\"color:orange\">\"BTCEUR\"</span>, <span style=\"color:orange\">\"BTCUSD\"</span>, <span style=\"color:orange\">\"ETHBTC\"</span>, and <span style=\"color:orange\">\"ETHEUR\"</span>.

It's impossible to show all of the price movement in the chart, but we don't need, it's quite enough to show the result of these transactions in the selected timeframe. For example let's get the firs row in our dataframe. We interested in the <span style=\"color:yellow\">open</span> and <span style=\"color:yellow\">close</span> values. Here we see that open is 15798 and close - 15788, the close is lower then open it mean's that we have down trend and the candle is red. The high of candle is difference beetween open and close.
